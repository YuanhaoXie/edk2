/**
  This function updates the SMRAM save state on the currently executing CPU
  to resume execution at a specific address after an RSM instruction.  This
  function must evaluate the SMRAM save state to determine the execution mode
  the RSM instruction resumes and update the resume execution address with
  either NewInstructionPointer32 or NewInstructionPoint.  The auto HALT restart
  flag in the SMRAM save state must always be cleared.  This function returns
  the value of the instruction pointer from the SMRAM save state that was
  replaced.  If this function returns 0, then the SMRAM save state was not
  modified.

  This function is called during the very first SMI on each CPU after
  SmmCpuFeaturesInitializeProcessor() to set a flag in normal execution mode
  to signal that the SMBASE of each CPU has been updated before the default
  SMBASE address is used for the first SMI to the next CPU.

  @param[in] CpuIndex                 The index of the CPU to hook.  The value
                                      must be between 0 and the NumberOfCpus
                                      field in the System Management System
                                      Table (SMST).
  @param[in] CpuState                 Pointer to SMRAM Save State Map for the
                                      currently executing CPU.
  @param[in] NewInstructionPointer32  Instruction pointer to use if resuming to
                                      32-bit execution mode from 64-bit SMM.
  @param[in] NewInstructionPointer    Instruction pointer to use if resuming to
                                      same execution mode as SMM.

  @retval 0    This function did modify the SMRAM save state.
  @retval > 0  The original instruction pointer value from the SMRAM save state
               before it was replaced.
